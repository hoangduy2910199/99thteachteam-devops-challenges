Tranding platform architecture.

1. Overview

    This architecture for a trading platform designed for high availability, scalability, disaster resilience, security and cost efficiency. It follows an active-active multi-region model to ensure low latency, fault tolerance, and seamless failover. Compute resources are deployed using serverless and auto-scaling solutions (e.g., AWS Fargate) to support dynamic workloads while optimizing costs.

3. Key feaures and how to achieve them.
    ## a. High Availability & Resiliency  
    - **CloudFront + Route 53** ensure low-latency access and intelligent traffic routing.  
    - **Global Accelerator** provides automatic failover and high availability.  
    - **Active-active multi-region deployment** with real-time data replication across regions.  
    - **Multi-AZ deployment** improves availability and fault tolerance.  

    ## b. Scalability  
    - **ECS Fargate, API Gateway, Aurora Cluster, and DynamoDB** use **on-demand auto-scaling** to handle varying workloads.  

    ## c. Security  
    - **Amazon Cognito** handles secure user authentication.  
    - **AWS WAF** protects against common attacks (SQL injection, DDoS, etc.).  

    ## d. Low Latency  
    - **CloudFront** caches static content at edge locations for faster access.  
    - **Global Accelerator** routes traffic over the AWS backbone to the nearest region, reducing latency.  

    ## e. Cost-Effectiveness  
    - **Leverage serverless services** to reduce operational overhead.  
    - **Use Spot Instances** for non-critical workloads to optimize costs.  
    - **Optimize storage** by using tiered storage solutions like **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**.  

    ## f. Observability.
    - **Monitoring & Metrics**: Use Amazon CloudWatch to collect and analyze metrics from ECS Fargate, API Gateway, ALB, and databases..
    - **Alerting**: Leverage Amazon SNS and CloudWatch Alarms trigger incident alert in real-time.
